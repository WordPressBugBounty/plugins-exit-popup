== Description ==
Exit Popup enables you to display a jQuery modal window, which can include text, images, videos, forms, maps and so on, before a visitor leaves your website.

<strong>Exit Popup intelligently detects mouse behaviors and then pops up a modal window when your visitors are about to close the current web page</strong>, helping you increase your landing page conversion rates, newsletter subscribers, and so on.
From experience, you can expect a 7% to 12% conversion rate increase - depending on your audience, traffic quality, and offer.

- Display almost anything you could display on a normal web page using HTML
- WordPress shortcode can be used in popup content + WPML compatibility
- Control the Height and Width of your Popup window
- Control how often your visitors see the popup
